## 📋 Findings

### Critical Issues: **None** ✅

### Warnings (Minor)

1. **Unused Image import in Hero.tsx** (Line 5)
   - `next/image` is imported but profile image is placeholder
   - *Impact*: Minor, will be used when real image is added

2. **Hero "View my work" links to `/projects`**
   - Route `/projects` doesn't exist (should be `/#projects`)
   - *Impact*: Low - will 404 until fixed

### Suggestions (Nice-to-have)

1. **Extract social links to config file**
   - Social arrays are duplicated in Navbar, Hero, Contact, Footer
   - Create `src/lib/socials.ts` for single source of truth

2. **Add metadata to individual pages**
   - Blog, About, Garage pages could have unique SEO titles
   - Currently using template from layout.tsx (works, but custom is better)

3. **Add profile image**
   - Currently shows "AP" placeholder
   - Add actual image to `/public/images/profile.png`

4. **Consider adding loading states**
   - GitHubHeatmap shows "Loading..." but other data could benefit too

## 🔧 Recommended Fixes

### Quick Fixes (< 5 min each)

```typescript
// 1. Fix Hero.tsx - Update "View my work" link
// Line 85: Change from:
<Link href="/projects">
// To:
<Link href="/#projects">
```

### Future Enhancements

- [ ] Create `/src/lib/socials.ts` for social link config
- [ ] Add actual profile image
- [ ] Add page-specific metadata exports
- [ ] Add `@next/bundle-analyzer` for build analysis
